Advanced analysis and visualization of free recall data in Python.

Features:
* A large library of advanced analyses, tested against published benchmarks
* Flexible analysis customization and plotting
* Tools for exploratory analysis of large datasets
* Extensive automated testing to ensure analysis correctness
* Based around a simple and flexible table-based data format
* Comprehensive [documentation](https://psifr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/overview.html) and [user guide](https://psifr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/overview.html)

The name Psifr is pronounced "cipher". It's taken from Psi, in reference to the field of psychology, and FR for free recall.

      Raster plot showing each recall in a free recall experiment. Color indicates serial position; yellow items were presented late in the list, while purple items were presented at the beginning. Magenta squares indicate intrusions of items that were not presented during the study list.

## Installation

You can install the latest stable version of Psifr using pip:

```bash
pip install psifr
```

You can also install the development version directly from the code
repository on GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/mortonne/psifr
```

## Quickstart

To plot a serial position curve for a sample dataset:

```python
from psifr import fr
df = fr.sample_data('Morton2013')
data = fr.merge_free_recall(df)
recall = fr.spc(data)
g = fr.plot_spc(recall)
```

See the [user guide](https://psifr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/overview.html) for detailed documentation on importing and analyzing free recall datasets.

Also see the Jupyter notebooks for more analysis examples:
* [Recall performance](https://github.com/mortonne/psifr-notebooks/blob/master/demo_recall.ipynb)
* [Temporal clustering](https://github.com/mortonne/psifr-notebooks/blob/master/demo_lag_crp.ipynb)

## Importing data

Generally the best way to get your data into shape for analysis in Psifr is to create a CSV (or TSV) file with one row for each event in the experiment, including study events (i.e., item presentations) and all recall attempts (including repeats and intrusions).
See [importing data](https://psifr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/import.html) for details.

A number of archival free recall datasets are available in the Matlab-based EMBAM format.
Data archives for a number of studies are available from the [UPenn](https://memory.psych.upenn.edu/Data_Archive) and [Vanderbilt](https://memory.psy.vanderbilt.edu/w/index.php/Publications) memory labs.
If you have data in [EMBAM](https://github.com/vucml/EMBAM) format, use `matlab/frdata2table.m` to convert your data struct to a table with standard format.
Then use the Matlab function `writetable` to write a CSV file which can then be read into Python for analysis.
