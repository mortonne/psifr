=================

This guide focuses on how to contribute a new analysis to Psifr. However, there are lots of other ways to contribute, like adding more detail to docstrings or adding additional unit tests. If you're not sure whether a new feature or change would be a good fit, just ask! You can use GitHub's `issues <https://github.com/mortonne/psifr/issues>`_ system to ask questions, request a feature, or report a bug.
